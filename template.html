                        RTMP is TCP based-protocol that works with a 3-step process once the TCP connection is established
                        (cf figure 1). 

                        <ol>
                            <li>First the handshake to establish connection between the client and the server (cf figure 2).</li>

                        It encapsulates MP3/AAC audio and MP4/FLV video multimedia streams that can be decoded on the web 
                        by a Flash plugin. Flash Player is a browser plugin to run applications inside a webpage. The Flash .swf 
                        application uses code to load the RTMP data and the Flash Player system will automatically decode 
                        that into live audio/video. To ensure smooth video streaming despite bandwidth fluctuations, 
                        RTMP keeps the connection between the streaming server and the video player continuously open 
                        during the process. Audio, video and others data are delivered separately and are broken into 
                        segments by the protocol to be transmitted with consistence. These segments have the same duration 
                        and allow to adapt the stream according to the quality of the connection of the client. <br>
                        Nowadays with the deprecation of flash, RTMP will not be used for video delivery to end users 
                        anymore when doing a live stream with CDN. RTMP will stream the content to a server and then 
                        the stream will be transformed to HLS(cf figure 3).

                        RTMP is amongst the best in providing multicast support since it allows to deliver a stream to many
                        users without initiating a connection for each of them. <br>
                        In fact, there is a direct pointer from the server to the player and the latter only consider 
                        data corresponding to that pointer and doesn’t rely on any buffer to cache files locally on the 
                        user computer. Thus the server and the player are in a constant connection and monitoring can provide 
                        precise and specific statistics what a user did during the video.

                        Due to its default usage of 1935 port, RTMP is not accessible when restrictive firewalls are working.

                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                        The main feature of RTMP is to provide an adaptive bitrate streaming service where users can do 
                        live streams and deliver them to several platforms(cf figure 4). In the case of a video streaming, the streamer 
                        may ask the service provider to be able to read the user chat and be able to communicate with viewers.
                        This requires a low-latency real time messaging protocol, RTMP. Flash player may be discontinued 
                        but the gaming community still uses it. On the users side, they do not want an data to be temporarily 
                        stored in the dedicated browser folder in their computers and would rather stay on sync with 
                        the stream and not see lost frames. The users prefer low quality videos over a laggy stream, 
                        their priority is to be able to see what the player is doing and comment it in as little time 
                        as possible.  This protocol’s pointer is always on sync with the stream, therefore, it does not 
                        display in-time lost content and causes cumulative delays. 
                        Unlike other progressive media players, there is none to very little buffering in RTMP, user experience 
                        is optimized, and poor network statistics are accounted for. This use case’s aim is to display 
                        the low latency and adaptation to bandwidth changes RTMP is able to provide.

                <img src="./images/architecture.png">
                In the above image, the classical architecture of RTMP is presented. The latter involves three actors:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <b>source</b>: he is the one who wants to broadcast the video. To do this, it sends an RTMP stream to the second actor, which is the server.</li>
                    <li>An <b>RTMP Media Server</b>: it receives the RTMP stream, converts it into another format which is supported by HTML5 and sends it to clients which ask the stream.</li>
                    <li>A <b>client</b>: he is the one who wants to see the stream. To do this, he asks the RTMP Media Server and he receives the RTMP stream converted in another format which is then displayed in its browser. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                In our case, the conversion is not done by the RTMP Media Server but with the player available in the webpage. It converts the RTMP stream into MP4 segments and feeds the segments into an HTML5 video element.

                <h4 class="card-title">Node Media Server</h4>
                <a href="https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server">Node Media Server</a> is a Node.js
                implementation of RTMP Media Server. Other protocols are available through this library.
                <br>
                This server was chosen for the demonstration because it can be run whether on MacOS or Linux.
                To start the server, run the following line in the folder where <em>app.js</em> is located:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>node app.js</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Node Media Server is not the most famous solution for the RTMP Server. You can
                use <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module">Arut's project</a> which is based on an NGINX
                server and simple to implement.
                Nevertheless, it will not be easily portable on macOS as it needs libraries which are not available on
                this OS.

                <h4 class="card-title">Start Streaming</h4>
                Go back to <strong>OBS</strong> and click on <em>Start Streaming</em>.<br>
                If you followed each step, in your RTMP server terminal you can see the following lines:
